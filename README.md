The project is an attempt to make a card matching. 
Cards being by being face up for a small time period, half a second maybe, to give the player a chance to memorise them. 
The player then clicks on each card to attempt to match it with its pair. 

I started by taking the Loves Maths challenge to use the game area. 
I removed the main game and replaced it with a grid area of 10 divs. 
I then took out three of the buttons and changed the addition game button to a start button. 

I wanted to use a font awesome start button but so far have been unable to make it work. The button displayed it different from the start button I wanted. 

I have tried to use code from Code Institute challenges to change the card border to red when clicked and to change the card color. So far this has not worked. 

I need to asign a random color selection from an array and pair the cards in order to match them and increase the score. 

The code seems to work in a different IDE but not on Gitpod.
